%   Takes an input structure of the form: neuron(n).condition(c).spikesm, finds
% the neurons with tuning, and returns a structure of form Data(neurons/conditions).spikes
% which can be fed to 'VarVsMean'.
%
%   For each neuron, two measurements of tuning are computed: the 'response index' and the 'tuning range'.
%   The response index measures the degree to which firing rates change from baseline, regardless of
% whether those responses are tuned.  It is the mean absolute rate change, normalized by that expected due
% to sampling error (computed via bootstrap).
%   The tuning range measures whether stimulus-interval firing rates are different across conditions. 
% It is just the max firing rate (across conditions) minus the minimum firing rate, corrected for 
% sampling error by subtracting off a bootstrapped value.
%   A neuron is passed if both the response index and the tuning range exceed their respective thresholds.
%
% usage: [goodData, goodCells, cellSummary] = TunedCells(nStruct, baselineInt, stimulusInt)
%
% (Optional arguments are 'minResponseIndex' and 'minTuningRange'.  If not supplied, defaults are 2 and 5).
%
% INPUTS:
% Each element of 'nStruct' is data from one neuron. For each neuron, there should be a field that 
% indexes across conditions/stimuli.  e.g. neuron(1).condition(3).spikes or cell(1).target(1).spikes.
% The 'spikes' field should be of the same format expected by 'VarVsMean':
% one row per trial, time flowing horizontally, logical 1's and 0's for spike vs no spike.
% The 'spikes' field MUST be named 'spikes'.
% 
% 'baselineInt' and 'stimulusInt' are each 2-element vectors of the times for which the baseline and
% stimulus-driven firing rates will be measured.  For example, [0 100] and [300 400];
% Ideally these are of similar length (the bootstrap won't be quite right otherwise).
% That said, it should be fine if the stimulus interval is longer than the basline interval.
% The bootstrap will just overcorrect slightly, and the result will be conservative.
%
% The optional arguments, 'minResponseIndex' and 'minTuningRange', can override the threshold 
% values for the minimum response index and the minimum tuning range.
%
% OUTPUTS:
% 'goodData' can be fed straight into 'VarVsMean'.  It has one element per neuron/condition
% it contains only data from the cells that passed.
%
% 'goodCells' is a list of the cells that passed.
% 
% 'cellSummary' gives some summary statistics for each cell (including the response index and tuning range)
