% [s] = smooth(x, sigma, [binout=1])          Smooth a signal
%
% sigma is the std of the smoothing gaussian, in bins. Each bin is one
% vector element in x. Wraparound not considered here, watch out for it.
% 
% binout must be an integer >= 1. This is the subsampling rate for the
% output. Note that this is subsampling, not binning (sum will not be
% conserved). 
%
% Done in a dumb way here-- smoother prep should be directly in
% fourier space, not x-space.
