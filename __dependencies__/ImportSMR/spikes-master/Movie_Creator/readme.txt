===Changes========(Rowland - April 2002)===================
1. Have now got rid of the old AVI export routine - as it's 
   now built into Matlab (as of v6).
2. CreateMovie now acts on a timeslice as chosen in spikes
   by measuring from a psth / typing in the min/max boxes.
3. After a movie has first been created (eg. auto scaled)
   a message box now displays the max/min values for the
   movie frames, so it can be recreated with a meaningful
   scale.
