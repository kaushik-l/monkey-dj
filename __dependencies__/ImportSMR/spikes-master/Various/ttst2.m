function [h,p,ci,stats] = ttst2(x,y,alpha,tail)
%TTEST2 Hypothesis test: Compares the averages of two samples.
%   [H,P,CI,STATS] = TTEST2(X,Y,ALPHA,TAIL) performs a t-test to
%   determine whether two samples from a normal distribution (with
%   unknown but equal variances) could have the same mean.
%
%   The null hypothesis is: "means are equal".
%   For TAIL =  0  the alternative hypothesis is: "means are not equal."
%   For TAIL =  1, alternative: "mean of X is greater than mean of Y."
%   For TAIL = -1, alternative: "mean of X is less than mean of Y."
%   TAIL = 0 by default.
%
%   ALPHA is desired significance level (ALPHA = 0.05 by default). 
%   P is the p-value, or the probability of observing the given result
%     by chance given that the null hypothesis is true. Small values
%     of P cast doubt on the validity of the null hypothesis.
%   CI is a confidence interval for the true difference in means.
%   STATS is a structure with two elements named 'tstat' (the value
%     of the t statistic) and 'df' (its degrees of freedom).
%
%   H=0 => "Do not reject null hypothesis at significance level of alpha."
%   H=1 => "Reject null hypothesis at significance level of alpha."
