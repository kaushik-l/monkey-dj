You can select the binwidth by entering a binwidth, or if you put 0, it will leave just the raw spikes for statistical comparison. You can do this for all spikes, or just the burst spike train. You can also select either binned ISI or raw ISI rather than spike times themselves if you prefer. By selecting a cell and a variable position, you can choose which position to visualise when measuring the PSTH. Then choose any statistical test and ''OrbanizeIt!''';'';'Another option is to remove spontaneous, by selecting which position you want to measure and pressing "Find Spontaneous".
