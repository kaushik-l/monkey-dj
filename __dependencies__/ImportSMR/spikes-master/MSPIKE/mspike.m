% MSPIKE - MALTAB Neuronal Spike Pattern Analysis
% By Hazem Saliba Baqaen (Hazem@brown.edu). Designed on MATLAB 6.5.
% Brown University Departments of Psychology and Neuroscience, September 2004. 
% Supervisors: Professors Andrea and James Simmons. 
% (Credit due to Nicola Neretti for important suggestions)
%
% Inputs: One or more .csv data files exported by TDT's System3
% OpenEx, with ' Tref ' selected. See start data row and column specifier block
% below, or sample .csv file, for proper formatting. Also, see the code block
% below with the header " Other needed parameters..." for more inputs and
% defaults. The user must enter a list of the input files into
% InputFileList.txt and save it, and a list of the corresponding stimulus
% frequencies entered into FrequencyList.txt and save it if s/he wishes any
% periodicity analysis done (by setting period_select = 1). 
%
% Outputs: Image files (see Program functionality selector code block
% below)
%
% To change the way the output file names are adapted from the input file
% names, and the output path, you must edit the ' saveas ' statement in each of
% the corresponding functions. 
% This program is easily extensible with minor modification. See the
% comments for more details.
%
% Warning: Keep MATLAB in the foreground while running mspike and do not
% use the computer until mspike is done. Any open windows will be captured
% in the image files.
