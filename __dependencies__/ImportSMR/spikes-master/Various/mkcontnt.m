%MKCONTNT Make new contents.m file in the current working directory
%
%Copies the H1 line (first comment line) of all m-files found
%in the current working directory to a file named "contents.m".
%If such a file already exists, a backup copy of it is made to
%"contents.old". 
%
%For example, if the user has written several m-files 
%in the directory C:\MATLAB\MY_MFILES, he needs to make this the
%current working directory (using either CD or the path browser) 
%and then type "mkcontnt" at the Matlab prompt.
%
%It is important to note that any fancy editing done to a previous 
%version of contents.m will be lost. Only the top two lines from the
%old version are copied to the new version, but that number can easily
%be increased by minor modifications to the code. Use the top few
%lines of your contents.m files to describe in general terms what kinds 
%of tasks are performed by your m-files.
%
%Take the habit of writing informative H1 lines!!!  

%Tested with Matlab 5.2.1 for Windows 95
