% Discarding is done for the purposes of computing the ISIs, so the outputs

% The following code generates the all-order ISI histogram all in one shot,
% by plotting all the nonzero elements of the ISI matrix simultaneously. Thus, this
% is not the more intuitive method of composing the all-order ISIH by
% adding the first-order, second-order, etc. ISIHs in sequence. This approach saves
% computing time.
% The re-arrangement of the elements prior to plotting turned out to be
% redundant after adding the nonzeros command, which concatenates
% everything into a 1x[number of elements - number of zero elements] array.
