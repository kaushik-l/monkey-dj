function x=goodness2(a,b,t)

% x=goodness2(a,b,t)
%
% Does a standard squared goodness of fit for 2D data, by calculating the residuals
% between a (the real data) and b (the model line) and squaring them. I 
% then compare the model against a line constructed from the mean of the 
% data, to get a percentage of variance explained by the model.
%
% t is whether to use the mean ('m'), mean fractional error ('mfe'), r
% squared ('r2'), or a spontaneous value ('number')
%
% Make sure both vectors have the same dimensions
