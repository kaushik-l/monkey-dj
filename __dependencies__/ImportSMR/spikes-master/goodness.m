function x=goodness(a,b,t)

% x=goodness(a,b,t)
%
% Does a standard squared goodness of fit, by calculating the residuals
% between a (the real data) and b (the model line) and squaring them. I 
% then compare the model against a line constructed from the mean of the 
% data, to get a percentage of variance explained by the model.
%
% t is whether to use the mean ('m'), mean fractional error ('mfe'),
% a spontaneous value ('number'), or r2 ('r2')
%
% Make sure both vectors have the same dimensions
