Specifically, it contains the data from "cell 11", which is analyzed in Figure 6.</dd>		<dt><code>drift</code></dt>		<dd>Contains the data from the experiment described in <a href="http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/85/1/305">Reich et al. (2001)</a>. Specifically, it contains the drifting grating responses from cell 44/9s, which are depicted in the lower right of Figure 2.</dd>		<dt><code>phase</code></dt>		<dd>Contains the data from the experiment described in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00826.2002">Aronov et al. (2003)</a>. Specifically, it contains the responses from cells 410106.s and 410106.t, which are depicted in Figure 1B. Because the full dataset depicted in the paper is large, only data corresponding to every fourth phase is included.</dd>		<dt><code>inforate_uni</code> and <code>inforate_rep</code></dt>		<dd>These sets consist of synthetic data inspired by the experiment described in <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/20/14/5392">Reinagel and Reid (2000)</a>. <code>inforate_uni</code> consists of unique Poisson spike trains with a rate of 40 spikes/s. <code>inforate_rep</code> consists of repeated spike trains, where each spike in the set is jittered according to a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 0.6 ms.</dd>	</dl>	<h2>Demo scripts</h2>	<p>The example m-file scripts can be found in the <code>demo/</code> directory. Links to images of the output figures are provided below so that you can verify that the toolkit is functioning properly. <span class="alert">The performance of entropy and information methods is data-dependent. The results depicted in these demos are specific to the datasets analyzed&mdash;no conclusions about the methods' performance on other datasets are implied or should be inferred.</span> Please note that due to differences in the figure handling and plotting functions between Matlab and Octave, the demos will not run in Octave. While the demos can still serve as a template for your own analyses, Octave users must rely upon <code>staverify</code> to know that the toolkit was successfully installed.</p>	<h3>Formal information demos</h3>	<p>The script <code>demo_directformal</code> demostrates the use of the <code>directformal</code> function to compute the formal information rate on the <code>inforate_uni</code> and <code>inforate_rep</code> dataset. <a href="images/directformal.png">View the expected results</a>. The key graph is the lower-right panel. This shows information calculated via several different entropy methods, as a function of the "word length". The peak of the curve as it nears the vertical axis is the best estimate of information; the abrupt drop of the curve for very long words (small values of 1/L) reflects the amount of data available, and does not indicate an actual fall in the amount of information.</p>	<p>The script <code>demo_ctwmcmc_formal</code> demonstrates the use of the <code>ctwmcmc</code> function to compute the formal information rate on the same data, and compares the results with those obtained by <code>directformal</code>. <a href="images/ctwmcmc_formal.png">View the expected results</a>. As above, the key graph is the lower-right panel. Note that since the <code>ctwmcmc</code> method does not make use of a "word length" parameter, its results are shown as a horizontal band. Also please note that <code>ctwmcmc</code> and <code>nsb</code> analyses were performed with 1/8 of the available data, as compared to <code>plugin</code> or <code>tpmc</code>.</p>	<h3>Category-specific information demos</h3>There are three scripts that demonstrate how the toolkit quantifies the amount of information that an ensemble of spike trains conveys about a stimulus that can be characterized by discrete categories: <code>demo_directcat</code>, <code>demo_metric</code>, and <code>demo_binless</code>. When run, these scripts asks you to choose the <code>synth</code>, <code>taste</code>, <code>drift</code>, or <code>continuous</code> (<code>demo_binless</code> only) datasets. To bypass this query, you may set the <code>dataset</code> variable (e.g., <code>dataset='synth'</code>) before running the scripts. (Note that you must clear this variable in order to receive the query again.) All of these demos can be run in succession with <code>synth</code> and <code>taste</code> datasets using the <code>demo_all</code> script. Analysis of the <code>drift</code> dataset can take a long time on some computers, and therefore is not included in the <code>demo_all</code> script.	<p>Again, the key plot of interest is the graph in the lower-right of each figure. This graph shows information as a function of bin size (<code>demo_directcat</code>), temporal precision (<code>demo_metric</code>), or embedding dimension (<code>demo_binless</code>). The peaks of these curves (blue) are the single best estimates of information. These panels also show information estimates for shuffled data (red). This serves as a control for whether there is sufficient data to carry out a valid analysis. If the amount of data are sufficient, then the "shuffled" curve (red) should be well-separated from the original data curve (blue), and the amount of information in the shuffled curve should be near zero. In the examples shown here, this criterion is met for the metric space analysis (<code>demo_metric</code>), and the binless analysis (<code>demo_binless</code>), but not the direct categorical analysis (<code>demo_directcat</code>). The other panels of the demo figures show some of the intermediate results of the information analyses, and provide a way to characterize how neural information is coded. Please refer to the detailed description of these methods for further background (see the references on the <a href="intro.html">Introduction page</a>).</p>	<table border="1">		<tr>			<th>Demo name</th>			<th>Description</th>			<th colspan="4">Expected results</th>		</tr>		<tr>			<td><code>demo_directcat</code></td>			<td>Direct method category-specific information demo</td>			<td><a href="images/directcat_synth.png"><code>synth</code></a></td>			<td><a href="images/directcat_taste.png"><code>taste</code></a></td>			<td><a href="images/directcat_drift.png"><code>drift</code></a></td>			<td>&nbsp;</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td><code>demo_metric</code></td>			<td>Metric space method demo</td>			<td><a href="images/metric_synth.png"><code>synth</code></a></td>			<td><a href="images/metric_taste.png"><code>taste</code></a></td>			<td><a href="images/metric_drift.png"><code>drift</code></a></td>			<td>&nbsp;</td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td><code>demo_binless</code></td>			<td>Binless method demo</td>			<td><a href="images/binless_synth.png"><code>synth</code></a></td>			<td><a href="images/binless_taste.png"><code>taste</code></a></td>			<td><a href="images/binless_drift.png"><code>drift</code></a></td>			<td><a href="images/binless_continuous.png"><code>continuous</code></a></td>		</tr>	</table>	<p>The script <code>demo_metric_multi</code> demonstrates the use of the metric space method on the multineuron dataset <code>phase</code>. <a href="images/metric_phase.png">View the expected results</a>. In this figure, pay particular attention to the plot in the lower-left corner, which shows information as a function of temporal precision and label cost (an indication of the redundancy across multiple neurons). <span class="alert">This demo is very memory intensive. If you have trouble running it, try reducing the size of the analysis window by changing the values of <code>opts.start_time</code> and <code>opts.end_time</code>.</span></p>	<h3>Entropy method demos</h3>	<p>The script <code>demo_entropy</code> demonstrates all of the entropy methods included in the toolkit (except <code>nsb</code>) on examples drawn from a binomial distribution with 10 bins. <a href="images/entropy.png">View the expected results</a>. The function <code>demo_nsb</code> compares the <code>plugin</code>, <code>tpmc</code>, and <code>nsb</code> methods on undersampled data drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. <a href="images/entropy_nsb.png">View the expected results</a>. <span class="alert">Dataset generation and bootstrap variance estimation make use of a pseudorandom number generation. Therefore, results may differ slightly from system to system.</span></p></body></html>
