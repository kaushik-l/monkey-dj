% usage: Result = MeanFano(data, times, params)
%
% OVERVIEW (OBSOLETE)
%   This basically replicates 'VarVsMean' but uses the mean Fano factor (ie the mean of the 
%   individual-point FFs) rather than a regression.
%
%   Now that 'VarVsMean' uses a weighted regression (which should yeild an estimate very close
%   to the max likelihood slope) this function is essentially OBSOLETE.
%
%   This function computes the mean Fano Factor.
%   This is done at multiple timepoints, which the user inputs.
%
%   Unless asked otherwise, the distribution of mean counts is matched (via dowselection),
%   so that all timepoints have the same distribution of mean counts.
%
% INPUTS
%   There are 2 required inputs: 'data', and 'times', and one optional input 'params'
%   
%   'DATA'
%           A structure, each element of which contains a field 'spikes' which is a matrix with 1 row 
%       per trial and 1 column per millisecond.  Each entry should be a '1' (there was a spike in 
%       that ms on that trial) or a '0' (there wasn't).  All data should be time-aligned to some event.
%           For example, suppose you collect 100 trials, each with 200 ms of pre-target
%       data and 800 ms of post-target data. Your 'spikes' matrix would then be 100 by 1000 
%       (with one of these for each element of 'data').
%       E.G.               
%           trial 1     0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 ... 0 1 0 0 0 1
%           trial 2     0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 ... 0 0 1 0 1 0 
%           trial 3     0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 ... 0 1 0 0 0 0 
%             ...
%           trial n     1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 1 1 0 
%
%           Running this analysis only makes sense if you collected data for many neurons &/or many conditions.
%       Each element of 'data' should contain all the trials for one neuron/condition combination.  Thus, if you
%       collected data from 100 neurons using 10 conditions, 'data' would be length 1000.
%       **  The field containing the spike matrix MUST be named 'spikes'. **
%
%   'TIMES'
%           A vector of times for which the analysis should be performed.  In the above example, the data
%       spans 1000 ms, so 'times' might be 100:50:800.  This would compute the Fano factor every 50 ms starting
%       100 ms into the data and ending 200 ms before the data end.
%           You almost certainly DONT want to feed in every time (e.g. 1:1000 would be a bad choice).  This is
%       because 1) things will be slow, and 2) it becomes harder to match the distribution of mean counts as the
%       number of times increases.  As a result, more data will have to be excluded to manage the match.  Just 
%       ask for the times that are critical for your analysis, with a reasonable spacing (probably 20-50 ms 
%       between times is reasonable).
%           Also, keep in mind that the count window is centered on the times you ask for.  For example, the
%       default 'boxWidth' is 80 ms, which means the first entry in 'times' must be >40 ms.
%
%   'PARAMS'
%           This input structure is optional.  If you don't supply it, default values will be used.  You can
%       input params with some fields but not others (the unsupplied fields revert to the defaults).  The
%       fields are:
%           'boxWidth' is the width of the sliding window in which the count is made (default is 80 ms)
%           'matchReps' should be zero if you do not wish the firing rate distributions to 
%               be equalized across the times. When non-zero, that is the number of times 
%               the downselection is done (different random seed each time). (default is 10).
%           'binSpacing' determines the scale on which we try and match the firing rates.  It
%               is the bin width used to compute the distribution of spike counts. (default is 0.25 spikes).
%           'alignTime' allows you to specify the time that the neural responses are aligned to (e.g. target
%               onset). The 'times' field in the output will be with respect to that time.  This means that
%               you don't have to keep track of the alignment time for the purposes of subsequent plots / analyses.
%               (default is 0).
%           'initRand' If set to 1, 'rand' will be initialized. If set to 0, 'rand' is not initialized.  This
%               matters because 'rand' is used when downselecting data (deciding which points to ignore).
%               If you want the result to be identical every time 'VarVsMean' is called, don't set to 0.
%               So long as 'matchReps' isn't too small though, results will be very similar regardless
%               of whether rand is initialized. (default is 1).
%    NOTE: whether you override the defaults or not, the function informs you of the values used on the command line.
% 
% OUTPUT: 'Result' has the following fields:
%        FanoFactor: The Fano Factor for each time (after downselection to match distributions across times)
%        Fano_95CIs: The 95% Confidence intervals on the Fano Factor
%       scatterData: contains the data for the variance versus mean scatterplot
%     FanoFactorAll: Same as 'FanoFactor' but for all datapoints (no downselection or matching)
%     FanoAll_95CIs: 95% CIs on the above
%    scatterDataAll: Scatterplot data for the above
%    meanRateSelect: The mean rate (across all conditions/neurons) after downselection (should be fairly constant)
%       meanRateAll: The mean rate with no downselection (i.e. the population average) (this and above in spikes/s) 
%          distData: The distributions of firing rate counts (raw and downselected)
%             times: The times that the analysis was performed, including offset if 'alignTime' was nonzero
