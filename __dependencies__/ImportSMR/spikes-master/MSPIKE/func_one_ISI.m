% This following code block loops over sweeps, calculating 1st-order ISI's 
% for each sweep. Diagonal elements of each sweep's ISI 2-D sub-matrix ( ISI(:,:,sweep) )
% represent the sought intervals for the sweep in the first order. 
% The second order intervals would be the first upper off-diagonal, and 
% so on. 
% By concatenating the 1st-order ISI values (diagonals) for each sweep, we get the
% complete set for all sweeps, which are subsequently plotted. However, the
% zero elements are removed first so as not to skew the bar graph toward
% zero, since the zero elements on the diagonals are not real interval
% values but were generated to keep the 3-D ISI supermatrix cuboid-shaped.
% Removing those zero intervals is justified by the fact that the recording
% equipment are unable to assign two time stamps for two spikes that occur
% at the same time. This of course holds true for single-channel recording.

% The way to visualize the ISI matrix is as a 3-D cuboid which is a stack
% of 2-D sub-matrices each corresponding to a sweep. The dimensions (rows
% and columns) of these sub-matrices do not correspond directly to any
% quantities of interest.
